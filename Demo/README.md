# DInLoc++ demo

The implementation is based on InLoc (<https://github.com/HajimeTaira/InLoc_demo>).

The installation instructions can be found bellow.

# InLoc demo

This toolkit provides scalable indoor visual localization (InLoc) demo on InLoc dataset. 
Please send bug reports and suggestions to <htaira@ok.ctrl.titech.ac.jp>, <torii@sc.e.titech.ac.jp> . 

2019.5.1 Update. 
We open an online evaluation tool for visual localization on the InLoc dataset (<https://www.visuallocalization.net/>). The tool accepts the localization results in text format. Please use `` functions/utils/ImgList2text.m `` in this repository to convert .mat result file to the proper text format. 


## Installation

* Install dependencies

    * Netvlad (<https://www.di.ens.fr/willow/research/netvlad/>)
    * relja_matlab (<https://github.com/Relja/relja_matlab>)
    * vlfeat (<http://www.vlfeat.org/>)
    * matconvnet (<http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/>)
    * Inpaint nans (<https://jp.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/4551-inpaint-nans?requestedDomain=www.mathworks.com>)
    * yael (<http://yael.gforge.inria.fr/#>)

    Netvlad, relja_matlab, vlfeat, matconvnet, Inpaint nans are the submodules of this repository and automatically downloaded by `` git clone --recurse-submodules ``. 
    For yael, please follow installation procedure described in its page.
    Then modify `` startup.m `` to add path to all dependencies. 

* Compile mex function in functions/ht_pnp_function
    
    First, install ceres solver: 

    If you are on macOS, then just do `` brew install ceres-solver ``. Otherwise:

    ```
    git clone https://ceres-solver.googlesource.com/ceres-solver
    cd ceres-solver
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. 
    make
    sudo make install
    ```

    Then modify paths in `` functions/ht_pnp_function/make_PnP_mex.m `` and execute it in Matlab. 

## Quick Start

* Download InLoc dataset (<https://github.com/HajimeTaira/InLoc_dataset>)

* Download pre-trained CNN model from <http://www.di.ens.fr/willow/research/netvlad/>

* Execute `` startup `` and `` inloc_demo `` in Matlab

* Optional: `` sparse_demo `` executes the baseline indoor visual localization using spase features. 

## Outputs

`` InLoc_demo `` generates the matfile `` outputs/densePV_top10_shortlist.mat `` that contains localization results. 
It includes a struct array named `` ImgList `` that consists of fields named 
`` queryname `` (query image name), `` topNname `` (N retrieved database images), `` topNscore `` (retrieval scores), and `` P `` (estimated 6 DoF query poses [R t]). 
We are planning to build a evaluation server that computes the quantitative localization errors for the result files following this format. 
Until then, we can evaluate your own localization results if you send it to <htaira@ok.ctrl.titech.ac.jp>. 

## Details: Run InLoc with your own features and image retrieval

* Prepare your own features, image lists, and retrieval scores

    The toolkit requires multiple .mat files 
    containing list of database / query images, initial image retireval scores, and dense features for each image  as input. 
    All of them should be in one directory such as `` inputs ``. 

    * Image list

        `` query_imgnames_all.mat `` contains string cell array named `` query_imgnames_all `` that consists of image names of queries. 

        ```
        query imgnames_all = 
        {'IMG_0731.JPG', 
        'IMG_0732.JPG', 
        ...
        'IMG_1113.JPG', 
        'IMG_1114.JPG'};
        ```

        Similary, `` cutout_imgnames_all.mat `` contains string cell array named `` cutout_imgnames_all ``. 
        It consists of paths of cutout images from `` database/cutouts/ `` directory in WUSTL dataset. 

        ```
        cutout_imgnames_all = 
        {'CSE3/000/cse_cutout_000_0_0.jpg',
        'CSE3/000/cse_cutout_000_0_30.jpg', 
        ...
        };
        ```

    * Image retireval scores

        `` scores.mat `` contains single numeric array named `` score ``. 
        It contains the similarity score between query in each row and database in each column. 
        Indices of queries and database should follow indices defined by image lists. 

    * Features

        Dense features for queries and databases are in ``inputs/features/query/iphone7/XXX.features.dense.mat `` and `` inputs/features/database/cutouts/XXX.features.dense.mat ``.  
        "XXX" is the image name or path in image list. 
        Each file contains 1x5 cell array named `` cnn `` that consists of multiple-level CNN intermediate feature map for each cell. 
        We use 3rd and 5th layers for our coarse-to-fine matching, so we recommend to keep the other cells empty to eliminate loading time. 
        If there are no pre-computed features, our tool computes dense features by using model pre-trained as the part of NetVLAD.
