The search for sparse correspondences is done by HLOC. The codes that compose the  query files and run the HLOC are implemented in the scope of the HoloLens mapper GUI. The definition of the inputs / outputs and algorithm parameters is in JSON file called "sparse_localization.mg".

Please, follow the instructions of: https://github.com/michalpolic/hololens_mapper
to install the HoloLens mapper. 

Run the GUI, load the "sparse_localization.mg", and adjust the inputs. 

There are required three inputs for HlocQueryComposer node:
- the HLOC map directory (build by sparse map creator, i.e., "build_sparse_localization_map.mg")
- Query images directory (contains the images to be localized)
- the camera intrinsic (defined the same way as in COLMAP)

There are required two inputs for HlocLocalizer node:
- the HLOC map directory (build by sparse map creator, i.e., "build_sparse_localization_map.mg")
- the query file path generated by HlocQueryComposer

The main output for us is the prickle file "query_localization_results.txt_logs.pkl" that contains all the valid matches that are used to evaluate what masks does correspond to moving objects.
